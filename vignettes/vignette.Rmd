Set your U.S. Census Bureau access key. Follow [this link](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) to obtain one. Specify your access key in the `messer()` or `powell_wiley()` functions using the `key` argument of the `get_acs()` function from the `tidycensus` package called within each or by using the `census_api_key()` function from the `tidycensus` package before running the `messer()` or `powell_wiley()` functions (see an example of the latter below).

```{r access_key_private, echo=FALSE}
source("../dev/private_key.R")
tidycensus::census_api_key(private_key)
```

```{r access_key_public, eval=FALSE}
tidycensus::census_api_key("...") # INSERT YOUR OWN KEY FROM U.S. CENSUS API

### Compute NDI (Messer)

Compute the NDI (Messer) values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for Georgia, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Messer et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-006-9094-x) with the following socio-economic status (SES) variables: 

| Characteristic | SES dimension | ACS table source | Description |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| OCC | Occupation | C24030 | Percent males in management, science, and arts occupation |
| CWD | Housing | B25014 | Percent of crowded housing |
| POV | Poverty | B17017 | Percent of households in poverty |
| FHH | Poverty | B25115 | Percent of female headed households with dependents |
| PUB | Poverty | B19058 | Percent of households on public assistance |
| U30 | Poverty | B19001 | Percent households earning <$30,000 per year |
| EDU | Education | B06009 | Percent earning less than a high school education |
| EMP | Employment | B23001 (2010 only); B23025 (2011 onward) | Percent unemployed |

```{r messer}
messer2010GA <- ndi::messer(state = "GA", year = 2010)
```

One output from `messer()` function is tibble containing the identification, geographic name, NDI (Messer) values, and raw census characteristics for each tract.

```{r messer_out1}
messer2010GA$ndi
```

A second output from `messer()` function is the results from the principal component analysis used to compute the NDI (Messer) values.

```{r messer_out2}
messer2010GA$pca
```

A third output from `messer()` function is a tibble containing a breakdown of the missingness of the census characteristics used to compute the NDI (Messer) values.

```{r messer_out3}
messer2010GA$missing
```

We can visualize the NDI (Messer) values geographically by linking them to spatial information from `tigris` and plotting with the `ggplot2` package suite.

```{r messer_plot, fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
# Obtain the 2010 counties from the "tigris" package
county2010GA <- tigris::counties(state = "GA", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
county2010GA$GEOID <- substring(county2010GA$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2010GA <- tigris::tracts(state = "GA", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
tract2010GA$GEOID <- substring(tract2010GA$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Join the NDI (Messer) values to the census tract geometry
GA2010messer <- merge(tract2010GA, messer2010GA$ndi, by = "GEOID")

```

The results above are at the tract-level. The NDI (Messer) values can also be calculated at the county level. 

```{r messer_county, fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
messer2010GA_county <- ndi::messer(geo = "county", state = "GA", year = 2010)

### Compute NDI (Powell-Wiley)

Compute the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values (2016-2020 5-year ACS) for Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Andrews et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17445647.2020.1750066) and [Slotman et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108002) with socio-economic status (SES) variables chosen by [Roux and Mair (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05333.x):

| Characteristic | SES dimension | ACS table source | Description |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| MedHHInc | Wealth and income | B19013 | Median household income (dollars) |
| PctRecvIDR | Wealth and income | B19054 | Percent of households receiving dividends, interest, or rental income |

More information about the [codebook](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/NeighDeprvIndex_Methods.pdf) and [computation](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/NeighDeprvIndex_Methods.pdf) of the NDI (Powell-Wiley) can be found on a [GIS Portal for Cancer Research](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/files.html#soc-dep) website.

```{r powell_wiley}
powell_wiley2020DMVW <- ndi::powell_wiley(state = c("DC", "MD", "VA", "WV"), year = 2020)
```

One output from `powell_wiley()` function is tibble containing the identification, geographic name, NDI (Powell-Wiley) values, and raw census characteristics for each tract.

```{r powell_wiley_out1}
powell_wiley2020DMVW$ndi
```

A second output from `powell_wiley()` function is the results from the principal component analysis used to compute the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values.

```{r powell_wiley_out2}
powell_wiley2020DMVW$pca
```

A third output from `powell_wiley()` function is a tibble containing a breakdown of the missingness of the census characteristics used to compute the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values.

```{r powell_wiley_out3}
powell_wiley2020DMVW$missing
```

A fourth output from `powell_wiley()` function is a character string or numeric value of a standardized Cronbach's alpha. A value greater than 0.7 is desired.

```{r powell_wiley_out4}
powell_wiley2020DMVW$cronbach
```

We can visualize the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values geographically by linking them to spatial information from `tigris` and plotting with the `ggplot2` package suite.

```{r powell_wiley_plot, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}

                   subtitle = "DC, MD, VA, and WV tracts as the referent")
```

Like the NDI (Messer), we also compute county-level NDI (Powell-Wiley).

```{r powell_wiley_county, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}

### Advanced Features

#### Imputing missing census variables

In the `messer()` and `powell_wiley()` functions, missing census characteristics can be imputed using the `missing` and `impute` arguments of the `pca()` and `fa()` functions in the `psych` package called within the `messer()` and `powell_wiley()` function, respectively. Impute values using the logical `imp` argument (currently only calls `impute = "median"` by default, which assigns the median values of each missing census variable for a geography).

```{r powell_wiley_imp, results='hide', fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
powell_wiley2020DC <- ndi::powell_wiley(state = "DC", year = 2020) # without imputation
powell_wiley2020DCi <- ndi::powell_wiley(state = "DC", year = 2020, imp = TRUE) # with imputation

table(is.na(powell_wiley2020DC$ndi$NDI)) # n=13 tracts without NDI (Powell-Wiley) values
table(is.na(powell_wiley2020DCi$ndi$NDI)) # n=0 tracts without NDI (Powell-Wiley) values

# Obtain the 2020 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2020DC <- tigris::tracts(state = "DC", year = 2020, cb = TRUE)

# Join the NDI (Powell-Wiley) values to the census tract geometry

#### Assign the referent (U.S.-Standardized Metric)

To conduct a contiguous US-standardized index, compute an NDI for all states as in the example below that replicates the nationally standardized NDI (Powell-Wiley) values (2013-2017 ACS-5) found in [Slotman et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108002) and available from a [GIS Portal for Cancer Research](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/files.html#soc-dep) website. To replicate the nationally standardized NDI (Powell-Wiley) values (2006-2010 ACS-5) found in [Andrews et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17445647.2020.1750066) change the `year` argument to `2010` (i.e., `year = 2010`).

```{r national}
us <- tigris::states()
n51 <- c("Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands", "Guam", "American Samoa",
         "Puerto Rico", "United States Virgin Islands")
y51 <- us$STUSPS[!(us$NAME %in% n51)]

start_time <- Sys.time() # record start time
powell_wiley2017US <- ndi::powell_wiley(state = y51, year = 2017)
end_time <- Sys.time() # record end time
time_srr <- end_time - start_time # Calculate run time
powell_wiley2017US
```

```{r national_hist, fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
ggplot2::ggplot(powell_wiley2017US$ndi, ggplot2::aes(x = NDI)) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "white") + 
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Histogram of US-standardized NDI (Powell-Wiley) values (2013-2017)",
                   subtitle = "U.S. census tracts as the referent (including AK, HI, and DC)")
```
The process to compute a US-standardized NDI (Powell-Wiley) took about `r round(time_srr, digits = 1)` minutes to run on a machine with the features listed at the end of the vignette.

### Additional metrics socio-economic deprivation and disparity 

Since version v0.1.1, the `ndi` package can compute additional metrics of socio-economic deprivation and disparity beyond neighborhood deprivation indices, including:

1. `anthopolos()` function that computes the Racial Isolation Index (RI) based on [Anthopolos et al. (2011)](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2011.06.002) with data from the ACS-5.
2. `bravo()` function that computes the Educational Isolation Index (EI) based on [Bravo et al. (2021)](https://www.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179384) with data from the ACS-5.
3. `gini()` function that retrieves the Gini Index based on [Gini (1921)](https://www.doi.org/10.2307/2223319) from the ACS-5. 

#### Compute Racial Isolation Index (RI)

Compute the RI (Anthopolos) values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Anthopolos et al. (2011)](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2011.06.002) that assessed the racial isolation of the population that identifies as non-Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone. Multiple racial/ethnic subgroups are available in the `anthopolos()` function, including:

| ACS table source | racial/ethnic subgroup | character for `subgroup` argument |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| B03002_002 | Not Hispanic or Latino | NHoL |
| B03002_003 | Not Hispanic or Latino, White alone | NHoLW |
| B03002_004 | Not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone | NHoLB |
| B03002_005 | Not Hispanic or Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native alone | NHoLAIAN |
| B03002_006 | Not Hispanic or Latino, Asian alone | NHoLA |
| B03002_007 | Not Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone | NHoLNHOPI |
| B03002_008 | Not Hispanic or Latino, Some other race alone | NHoLSOR |
| B03002_009 | Not Hispanic or Latino, Two or more races | NHoLTOMR |
| B03002_010 | Not Hispanic or Latino, Two races including Some other race | NHoLTRiSOR |
| B03002_011 | Not Hispanic or Latino, Two races excluding Some other race, and three or more races | NHoLTReSOR |
| B03002_012 | Hispanic or Latino | HoL |
| B03002_013 | Hispanic or Latino, White alone | HoLW |
| B03002_014 | Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone | HoLB |
| B03002_015 | Hispanic or Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native alone | HoLAIAN |
| B03002_016 | Hispanic or Latino, Asian alone | HoLA |
| B03002_017 | Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone | HoLNHOPI |
| B03002_018 | Hispanic or Latino, Some other race alone | HoLSOR |
| B03002_019 | Hispanic or Latino, Two or more races | HoLTOMR |
| B03002_020 | Hispanic or Latino, Two races including Some other race | HoLTRiSOR |
| B03002_021 | Hispanic or Latino, Two races excluding Some other race, and three or more races | HoLTReSOR |

A census geography (and its neighbors) that has nearly all of its population who identify with the specified race/ethnicity subgroup(s) (e.g., Not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone) will have an RI value that is close to 1. In contrast, a census geography (and its neighbors) that is nearly none of its population who identify with the specified race/ethnicity subgroup(s) (e.g., not Not Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American alone) will have an RI value that is close to 0.

```{r anthopolos, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
anthopolos2010NC <- ndi::anthopolos(state = "NC", year = 2010, subgroup = "NHoLB")

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2010NC <- tigris::tracts(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
tract2010NC$GEOID <- substring(tract2010NC$GEO_ID, 10)

                   subtitle = "NC census tracts (not corrected for edge effects)")
```

Current version of `ndi` package does not correct for edge effects (e.g., census geographies along the specified spatial extent border, coastline, or U.S.-Mexico / U.S.-Canada border) may have few neighboring census geographies and RI values in these census geographies may be unstable. A stop-gap solution for the former source of edge effect is to compute the RI for neighboring census geographies (i.e., the states bordering a study area of interest) and then use the estimates of the study area of interest.

```{r anthopolos_edge, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
# Compute RI for all census tracts in neighboring states
anthopolos2010GNSTV <- ndi::anthopolos(state = c("GA", "NC", "SC", "TN", "VA"),
                                     year = 2010, subgroup = "NHoLB")

# Crop to only North Carolina, U.S.A. census tracts
anthopolos2010NCe <- anthopolos2010GNSTV$ri[anthopolos2010GNSTV$ri$GEOID %in% anthopolos2010NC$ri$GEOID, ]

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2010NC <- tigris::tracts(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
tract2010NC$GEOID <- substring(tract2010NC$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Obtain the 2010 counties from the "tigris" package
county2010NC <- tigris::counties(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)

# Join the RI (Anthopolos) values to the census tract geometry
edgeNC2010anthopolos <- merge(tract2010NC, anthopolos2010NCe, by = "GEOID")

# Visualize the RI (Anthopolos) values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts 
ggplot2::ggplot() + 
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = edgeNC2010anthopolos, 
                   ggplot2::aes(fill = RI),
                   size = 0.05,
                   color = "white") +
   ggplot2::geom_sf(data = county2010NC,
                   fill = "transparent", 
                   color = "white",

#### Compute Educational Isolation Index (EI)

Compute the EI (Bravo) values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Bravo et al. (2021)](https://www.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179384) that assessed the educational isolation of the population without a four-year college degree. Multiple educational attainment categories are available in the `bravo()` function, including:

| ACS table source | educational attainment category | character for `subgroup` argument |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| B06009_002 | Less than high school graduate | LtHS |
| B06009_003 | High school graduate (includes equivalency) | HSGiE |
| B06009_004 | Some college or associate's degree | SCoAD |
| B06009_005 | Bachelor's degree | BD |
| B06009_006 | Graduate or professional degree | GoPD |

A census geography (and its neighbors) that has nearly all of its population with the specified educational attainment category (e.g., a four-year college degree or more) will have an EI value that is close to 1. In contrast, a census geography (and its neighbors) that is nearly none of its population with the specified educational attainment category (e.g., with a four-year college degree) will have an EI value that is close to 0.

```{r bravo, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
bravo2010NC <- ndi::bravo(state = "NC", year = 2010, subgroup = c("LtHS", "HSGiE", "SCoAD"))

# Obtain the 2010 census tracts from the "tigris" package
tract2010NC <- tigris::tracts(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)
# Remove first 9 characters from GEOID for compatibility with tigris information
tract2010NC$GEOID <- substring(tract2010NC$GEO_ID, 10) 

# Obtain the 2010 counties from the "tigris" package
county2010NC <- tigris::counties(state = "NC", year = 2010, cb = TRUE)

# Join the RI (Bravo) values to the census tract geometry
NC2010bravo <- merge(tract2010NC, bravo2010NC$ei, by = "GEOID")

# Visualize the RI (Bravo) values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts 
ggplot2::ggplot() + 
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = NC2010bravo, 
                   ggplot2::aes(fill = EI),
                   size = 0.05,
                   color = "white") +
   ggplot2::geom_sf(data = county2010NC,
                   fill = "transparent", 
                   color = "white",
                   size = 0.2) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  ggplot2::labs(fill = "Index (Continuous)",
                caption = "Source: U.S. Census ACS 2006-2010 estimates") +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Educational Isolation Index (Bravo), without a four-year college degree",
                   subtitle = "NC census tracts (not corrected for edge effects)")
```

Can correct for one source of edge effect in the same manner as shown for the RI (Anthopolos) metric.

#### Retrieve the Educational Isolation Index (EI)

Retrieve the Gini Index values (2006-2010 5-year ACS) for North Carolina, U.S.A., census tracts. This metric is based on [Gini (1921)](https://www.doi.org/10.2307/2223319) and the `gini()` function retrieve the estimate from the ACS-5. 

According to the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/about/metrics/gini-index.html): "The Gini Index is a summary measure of income inequality. The Gini coefficient incorporates the detailed shares data into a single statistic, which summarizes the dispersion of income across the entire income distribution. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0, indicating perfect equality (where everyone receives an equal share), to 1, perfect inequality (where only one recipient or group of recipients receives all the income). The Gini is based on the difference between the Lorenz curve (the observed cumulative income distribution) and the notion of a perfectly equal income distribution."

```{r gini, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
